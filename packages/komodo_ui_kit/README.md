# UI Kit of Komodo Platform for Flutter

## Main rules

Before adding anything new to our project, we should ask ourselves, "Can we incorporate this package into our independent project?" If the addition brings valuable syntax sugar, improvements, or new libraries that enhance the usage of the package, then it's a good choice. However, if the proposed addition doesn't provide any significant benefits, it's better to avoid it.

## TODO
- [ ] Why do we use `Theme.of(context)`? We don't know how user have set his project and do we have any colors or texts for example for `labelLarge`
- [ ] Create documentation for the main widgets
