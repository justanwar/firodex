# Komodo Wallet v0.9.3 Release Notes

This release sharpens sign-in convenience, analytics coverage, and operational resilience ahead of the 0.9.3 cut. Highlights include one-click remember-me login, a dual analytics pipeline with Matomo support, a hardened feedback workflow, and improved compliance guardrails across platforms.

## 🚀 New Features
- **One-Click Remember Me Sign-In** ([@CharlVS], #3041) - Adds a quick login toggle that remembers hashed wallet metadata, auto-detects password manager autofill, and lets you resume the last wallet in one tap across desktop and mobile.
- **Feedback Portal Overhaul** ([@CharlVS], #3017) - Rebuilds the in-app feedback flow with provider plugins, optional contact opt-out, log attachments capped under 10 MB, and screenshot scrubbing for sensitive dialogs.

- **Version Insight Panel** ([@takenagain], #3109) - Adds a bloc-driven settings panel that surfaces app, mm2, and coin-config commits with periodic polling.

## 🎨 UI & UX
- **Asset List Loading Guards** ([@takenagain], #3134) - Hides portfolio rows until fiat pricing lands and shows placeholders instead of flickering zeroes.
- **Token Parent Labeling** ([@smk762], #2988) - Marks parent chains as native, adopts SDK display names, and keeps network suffixes visible across wallet views.
- **DEX Address Pill Consistency** ([@smk762], #2974) - Aligns the address pill style between list and detail flows for clearer swap confirmations.
- **Coin Detail Fiat Per Address** ([@takenagain], #3049) - Restores fiat balance context for individual addresses on the coin detail screen.
- **Memo Field Contextualization** ([@smk762], #2998) - Only renders memo inputs for Tendermint and ZHTLC assets so other withdrawals stay clutter-free.

## 🔒 Security & Compliance
- **Geo Blocker Bouncer Integration** ([@CharlVS], #3150) - Streams the new trading-status API, filters blocked assets during wallet bootstrap, and exposes an override for regulated builds.
- **Password Policy Hardening** ([@CharlVS], #3149/#3141) - Expands password limits to 128 characters across forms and makes validation consistent between Flutter and SDK layers.
- **Weak Password Flag Fix** ([@smk762], #3101) - Ensures the configuration flag actually respects weak-password bypass scenarios.
- **Pubkey Hygiene on Logout** ([@CharlVS], #3144) - Clears cached pubkeys when switching wallets or signing out to prevent stale address reuse.

## ⚡ Performance & Reliability
- **Fiat Onramp Debounce** ([@takenagain], #3125) - Debounces fiat amount edits so API calls only fire after user pauses typing.
- **Custom Token Activation Guardrails** ([@takenagain], #3129) - Waits for token propagation, limits retry loops, and deactivates test imports if the dialog closes without confirmation.
- **Legacy Wallet Import Stability** ([@takenagain], #3126) - Re-applies migrated coin lists after legacy imports and filters unsupported assets before activation.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Unauthenticated Coin State Fixes** ([@CharlVS], #3138) - Repairs coin list and sparkline loading when viewing portfolios before logging in.
- **DEX Precision Regression** ([@CharlVS], #3123) - Eliminates precision loss in taker forms and adds tests for large rational conversions.
- **macOS File Picker Entitlements** ([@CharlVS], #3111) - Restores the native file picker by adding the required read-only entitlement and window focus handling.
- **NFT IPFS Fallbacks** ([@takenagain], #3020) - Introduces an IPFS gateway manager with retries, cooldowns, and unit tests so NFT media loads consistently.
- **SDK Disposal Crash** ([@DeckerSU], #3117) - Avoids crashes when mm2 shuts down mid-fetch by guarding the periodic fetch loop.
- **Price/Version Reporting** ([@DeckerSU], #3115) - Ensures the settings screen shows the actual mm2 commit hash instead of a closure string.

- **Devcontainer Modernisation** ([@CharlVS], #3114) - Switches the devcontainer to lightweight .docker images and consolidates post-create provisioning.
